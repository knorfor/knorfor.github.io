		<p>I am climbing a giant bookshelf full of paperwork, urging my friend to keep up, literally hoisting myself up by protruding files. We are racing to get to a certain file, the one that belongs to that other boy at work. As soon as we find the file holding his schedule, we can steal it and give him all the shifts for next week. I give the paperwork to a familiar man behind a desk, and tell him I’m leaving. When he asks why, I say that I haven’t had any luck with jobs here, and I’m going to England. I think the England part is just to satisfy my flair for the dramatic. He replies,</p>

<p>“well, good luck with that, but there are no jobs anywhere.”</p>

<p>I feel unsure. I want to talk to my mom. As I walk out of the office, I’m in the hallway of a medical building. A is there, with a video camera and a couple of rough-looking women in fishnets and boustiers. K is standing next to me, and I ask her what they’re doing here.</p>

<p>“Filming one of those pornos where the doctor is putting his hands on the women, feeling their breasts&#8230;.oh, and also some vest-dancing,”</p>

<p>she says, as one of the women practices dancing suggestively in front of the video camera.</p>
