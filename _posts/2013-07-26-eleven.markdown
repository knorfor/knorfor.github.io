I am lying down, and I am crying. I don't understand why she keeps talking. Can't she tell I'm upset? I want to throw the phone against the wall. I want to tell her I'm in a yoga class and can't talk right now, but I can't form words, only angry, desperate sobs. I think of J, who agreed, perhaps reluctantly, to come to the class with me. He is still in the studio, standing against the wall.
