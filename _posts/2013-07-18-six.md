I think I'm in a yoga class, but I really want a cigarette. I find a long wooden walkway with a staircase that I can sit atop and smoke while it gets dark. There's a boy. I don't know if we talk or not before K comes running over and interrupts. I was worried she'd find me, see me smoking, but now that she has it seems okay. She ignores me anyway, enormously interested in the boy.
