I roll over into J’s back, bending my leg slightly so it just fits between his<br>
our crooked knees are twin diagonals pressing together and it hurts<br>
the puzzlescape of our limbs gives me a faintly technological impression<br>
pieces interlocking like automobile machinery<br>
in a J.G. Ballard kind of way<br>
but there is no car<br>
there is no crash
