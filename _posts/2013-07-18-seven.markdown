i am a lovemaker  
i am lightning ice cream  
melting like a wet dream  
into a desert of brown and orange  
and please,  
and please,  
and please.  
i am a pretty face  
utterly out of place  
the philosophy of my body  
downloaded, erased  
given meaning in so many ways  
at odds with the love  
i would have made.
